# CommentGPT

## Description 📝
CommentGPT is a Node.js package that uses the power of GPT-3.5 to automatically generate code comments. With CommentGPT, you can provide a file path as an argument, and it will read the code in the file and generate comments that describe what the code does. The comments are generated in natural language and do not contain any code block formatting, making it easy to understand and use.

## Functionality 🔧
CommentGPT uses the OpenAI API to generate comments, so you will need an API key to use it. The package generates a JSON file to store your API key, making it easy to use the package repeatedly without having to manually enter your API key every time.

## Usage 🚀
To use CommentGPT, simply run `npx commentgpt /file/path` or download it using `npm i commentgpt`. Then run `npm run commentgpt /file/path`. You will need to replace `/file/path` with the path to the file you want to generate comments for. Once you have done that, CommentGPT will automatically generate comments for your code.
