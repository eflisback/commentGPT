  "description": "CommentGPT is a Node.js package that uses the power of GPT-3.5 to automatically generate code comments. Simply provide a file path as an argument, and CommentGPT will read the code in the file and generate comments that describe what the code does. The comments are generated in natural language and do not contain any code block formatting. CommentGPT uses the OpenAI API to generate comments, so you will need an API key to use it. The package also relies on the dotenv package to load the API key from an environment file. CommentGPT is ideal for developers who want to improve the readability and maintainability of their code by adding descriptive comments. With CommentGPT, you can save time and effort by automating the process of writing comments, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your development work.",
